## üì¶ How It Works

1. User asks a question (e.g., _‚ÄúWho scored highest?‚Äù_)
2. The prompt + schema are sent to Gemini LLM
3. Gemini returns a valid SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ...`)
4. The app runs the query on `student.db` using SQLite
5. Results are shown in a clean UI (list or table)

---

## üß™ Sample Questions

- Who scored more than 80 marks?
- Give the student with the highest marks
- List all students in section A
- What is the average marks of students in section B?
- Show top 3 students with highest marks

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanchankhemnar/LLM-SQL.git
cd llm-sql

# Create virtual env (optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add secrets
mkdir .streamlit
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'" > .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Run locally
streamlit run app.py
```
ü§ñ Prompt Engineering
The app uses a carefully designed prompt that:

Informs the model about the table schema

Instructs it to return only valid SQL

Avoids extra explanation or markdown

Prompt includes table name, column types, and sample Q&A
