## üì¶ How It Works

1. User asks a question (e.g., _‚ÄúWho scored highest?‚Äù_)
2. The prompt + schema are sent to Gemini LLM
3. Gemini returns a valid SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ...`)
4. The app runs the query on `student.db` using SQLite
5. Results are shown in a clean UI (list or table)

  "Show total revenue generated by each category",
  "List total number of orders placed by each customer",
  "Show total spending by each customer",
  "Which customer spent the most overall",

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanchankhemnar/LLM-SQL.git
cd llm-sql

# Create virtual env (optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add secrets
mkdir .streamlit
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'" > .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Run locally
streamlit run app.py
```
ü§ñ Prompt Engineering
The app uses a carefully designed prompt that:

Informs the model about the table schema

Instructs it to return only valid SQL

Avoids extra explanation or markdown

Prompt includes table name, column types, and sample Q&A
